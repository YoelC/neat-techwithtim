Following TECHWITHTIM's tutorial, I ended up creating what I ***think*** is better than the code he ended up with in his video. It is a flappy bird game algorithm that ends up playing itself through genetic algorithms. It has many other features though, such as:
- Fast forwarding time
- Many tickers
- Cool data visualization
However, the assets aren't mine. All credit goes to their original creators.
